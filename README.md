**DSA & Competitive Programming Solutions**

Welcome to dsa-cp 👋
This repository contains my solutions to Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) and Competitive Programming (CP) problems, solved across multiple popular coding platforms.

The goal of this repository is to build strong problem-solving skills, improve algorithmic thinking, and maintain a well-structured reference for future revision and interviews.
**Platforms Covered **

Problems are taken from the following platforms:

LeetCode – Interview-focused DSA problems

Codeforces – Competitive programming & algorithmic challenges

CodeChef – Contest problems and practice sets
